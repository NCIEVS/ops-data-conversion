A Simple Program for Merging IAO.OWL with DUO.OWLKim L. OngProblem Description Some concepts in the Data Use Ontology (DUO) source, duo.owl, that are imported from the external Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) do not have a rdfs:label property. As a result, the hierarchy of DUO as a standalone vocabulary in DEV cannot be displayed properly for meaningful consumption by the users.  It is desirable to merge DUO into IAO so the resultant new duo.owl file will be self-contained and the browse can display a more descriptive hierarchy as a result. Technical ApproachThe technical approach for producing the new duo.owl is the following:• To merge namespace data contained in both owl files, iao.owl and duo.owl, developed a method for identifying all xmlns lines in iao.owl but not in duo.owl. • Add these xmlns lines to the list of xmlns lines in duo.owl.• Developed a method for extracting annotation properties (i.e., owl:AnnotationtProperty ) from both iao.owl and duo.owl.• Merge all annotation properties obtained above.• Developed a method for extracting object properties (i.e., owl:ObjectProperty) from both iao.owl and duo.owl.• Merge all object properties obtained above.• Developed a method for extracting data type properties (i.e., owl:DatatypeProperty ) from iao.owl.• Developed a method for extracting class (i.e., owl:Class), axiom (i.e., owl:Axiom), and individual (i.e., owl:NamedIndividual) data from iao.owl.• Developed a method for extracting class data from duo.owl.• Merge all class, axiom, and individual data obtained above.• Create the new duo.owl using all merged data obtained above.• For audit trail purpose, the new duo.owl will contain the version numbers of both the input duo.owl and iao.owl files and a time stamp. A method is developed for extracting both version numbers from the corresponding value of owl:versionIRI. A comment line is added to the new duo.owl similar to the following:<!-- Generated by merging duo.owl (version: 2020-02-03) with iao.owl (version: 2019-06-07) on 02/06/2020 -->• Develop a QA method for performing self-diagnosis of the new duo.owl file by tallying the annotation properties, object properties, data type properties, and classes in both iao.owl and duo.owl and compare these numbers with the corresponding value in the new duo.owl. the method will run automatically immediately after the new duo.owl file is generated.Run the ProgramThe program takes three file names duo.owl, iao.owl, and the new duo.owl as command line parameters. No jar file is needed.To compile:     javac -d . OWLMerger.javaTo run and generate duo_new.owl :     java -d64 -Xms512m -Xmx4g OWLMerger duo.owl iao.owl duo_new.owlThe Operations Team can run the program when new versions of DUO and IAO are published by their maintenance organization.
