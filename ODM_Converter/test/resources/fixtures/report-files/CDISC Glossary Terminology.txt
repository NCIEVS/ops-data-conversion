NOTE: Reliability pertains to questions concerning whether an instrument is accurate, repeatable, and sensitive. Reliability is distinguished from validation, which answers whether the instrument (e.g., questionnaire) actually measure the selected "construct" (latent variable). For example a balance (scale) is easily understood as a possibly valid instrument to measure body weight. Its reliability would be assessed by measuring the sensitivity, repeatability, and accuracy of the balance.
