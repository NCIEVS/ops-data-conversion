Analyses relate the difference in therapeutic benefits to the difference in costs between treatment alternatives. (NCI)	Pharmacoeconomic Study
C129001	C66739		Trial Type Response	PHARMACOGENETIC		A study that assesses variation in DNA sequence, usually within a single gene, and its effect on drug response.	Pharmacogenetic Study
C49661	C66739		Trial Type Response	PHARMACOGENOMIC		A study that identifies or assesses variations within the entire genome, including DNA, RNA, or transcriptional elements, and its effects on drug response.	Pharmacogenomic Study
C49663	C66739		Trial Type Response	PHARMACOKINETIC		A study of the process by which a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body. (NCI)	Pharmacokinetic Study
C161477	C66739		Trial Type Response	POSITION EFFECT		A type of study designed to evaluate the effect of body position during and/or after administration of the investigational product.	Position Effect Trial
C49657	C66739		Trial Type Response	PREVENTION	Prophylaxis Study	A type of study designed to identify actions necessary to permanently eliminate or reduce the long-term risk to human life as a result of a particular medication or treatment regimen.	Prevention Study
C174366	C66739		Trial Type Response	REACTOGENICITY		A type of study designed to evaluate the expected, acute types of immunological responses, sometimes considered excessive, following agent administration.	Reactogenicity Study
C49667	C66739		Trial Type Response	SAFETY		A study that assesses the medical risks to a subject. Safety is usually assessed by examining a wide range of clinical parameters, including adverse events, vital signs, physical exam, laboratory tests.	Safety Study
C161478	C66739		Trial Type Response	SWALLOWING FUNCTION		A type of study designed to evaluate the effect of the investigational product on the physiologic act of swallowing.	Swallowing Function Trial
C158287	C66739		Trial Type Response	THOROUGH QT	TQT Study	A type of study designed to evaluate the ability of an investigational product and/or approved drug to delay cardiac ventricular repolarization as detected by QT prolongation and other ECG parameters.	Thorough QT Study
C98791	C66739		Trial Type Response	TOLERABILITY		A type of safety study that assesses the degree to which overt adverse effects can be tolerated by the subject.	Tolerability Study
C49656	C66739		Trial Type Response	TREATMENT	Therapy Trial	A type of study designed to evaluate intervention(s) for treatment of disease, syndrome or condition.	Treatment Study
C161479	C66739		Trial Type Response	USABILITY TESTING		A type of study designed to evaluate the user experience with a product.	Usability Testing Study
C161480	C66739		Trial Type Response	WATER EFFECT		A type of study designed to evaluate the effects of water on investigational product safety and/or efficacy.	Water Effect Trial
