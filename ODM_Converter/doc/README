Terminology2ODM Converter README
================================

This program converts NCI Terminology Excel files from ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/ to ODM format according to the ideas set
out by the CDISC XML Technologies team.  

The schema files and xsl transforms in this package were supplied by various members of the CDISC team.

Prerequisits
============

Java (>=1.6.0) and ant (>=1.8.0) must be installed prio to using the converter.  Other dependencies (java libraries, 
scala compile, etc.) will be downloaded automatically the first time the converter is run.

Quickstart
==========

In a console, navigate to the directory in which the converter was unpacked (the directory in which this README file is
contained), and call

	ant
	
The first run will download and cache several java libraries (~18MB), compile the converter, download the NCI Excel and text
files from NCI ftp server and convert them to ODM and HTML. Subsequent calls will use the cached java libraries, but will 
download the Excel files again only if they do not exist and convert them.

The output can be found in {basedir}/build/out, along with copies of the schema files and an xsl transform for easy 
viewing of the output files in a browser.

Other ant targets
=================

run       - the default target (see "Quickstart")
download  - only download the nci excel files.  no conversion.
convert   - compile the converter and convert the excel files (these must alread be availble)
validate  - validate the ODM files against the schema
transform - transform the ODM files to html with the scl stylesheet
clean     - removes the compiled converter artifacts and generated ODM files.
scrub     - as for clean, but will also remove all downloaded/cached java libraries
